Description: Test the marginal correlation between a scalar response variable with a vector of explanatory variables 
    using the max-type test with bootstrap.
    The test is based on the max-type statistic and its asymptotic distribution
    under the null hypothesis of no marginal correlation.
    The bootstrap procedure is used to approximate the null distribution of the test statistic.
    The package provides a function for performing the test. For more technical details, refer to Zhang and Laber (2014) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2015.1106403>.
